## Usage

This webpage displays a navbar with the following elements:
* A 'View high scores' button which takes the user to the quiz's leaderboards (which also resets the timer as well as quitting the game if it is pressed once the quiz starts.) 
* A 'Time: 0' countdown timer which starts from 0 once the 'Start Quiz' purple button is pressed.

A title with a description of the functionality of the quiz and the 'Start Quiz' button. Once the quiz starts, 5 multiple answer questions will be displayed to the user. If the user selects the right answer, a "Correct!" text will be displayed underneath the possible answers of the next question. If the user answer incorrectly, a "Wrong!" text will be displayed instead; alongside subtract 10 seconds from the timer. 

If the timer hits 0 before the quiz is fully answered, the game will stop. At the end of the quiz, the user can input their initials to keep track of their progress and also view previous results.
